      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        Have you ever tried to learn new skills for work? I have a more fun
        question: Have you ever tried to find new hobbies but none of the
        YouTube videos interested you? <br />In my case, yes. I always tried to
        learn new job skills but all the course’s platforms I found were
        individual. Would you like to have a class with other people? If you
        don´t have friends, maybe with your family? <br />My company develops
        online courses that people use to learn new skills, find new jobs, or
        improve personal hobbies remotely. We additionally offer open classes
        that people can join and discuss the projects together as a group. This
        results in a multiple tool platform that connects people to reach
        knowledge.

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        My company especially focuses on young people between the ages of 14 and
        25. It is a friendly website where people can enjoy learning online and
        it is important to emphasize the word <em>online</em> because most do
        not usually enjoy learning or taking online courses.<br />
        Young people will enjoy starting new projects alongside classmates and
        instructors in video conferencing such as group chats.
        <br />It will focus on young people who like to learn new hobbies as
        they prepare professionally for work in the labor market.
