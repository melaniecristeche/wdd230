      <p>
        My company especially focuses on young people between the ages of 14 and
        25. It is a friendly website where people can enjoy learning online and
        it is important to emphasize the word <em>online</em> because most do
        not usually enjoy learning or taking online courses.<br />
        Young people will enjoy starting new projects alongside classmates and
        instructors in video conferencing such as group chats.
        <br />It will focus on young people who like to learn new hobbies as
        they prepare professionally for work in the labor market.
