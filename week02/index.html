        <p>People say that opposites attract and this can be true for elements of design as well. 
            Imagine a composition without contrast –every color, font, shape, etc. would be the same size, and that design would be rather dull. Contrast is the tool that makes a design “pop,” making it memorable for viewers.
  
          Contrast also aids in the usability of a composition. A design’s organization is dependent upon how contrast is used to lead a viewer’s eye towards what is most important. For instance, if all the content within a design was the same size, how would your audience know what information is the most significant? 
          Through contrast designers are able to highlight certain elements they want to emphasize, creating a focal point for an audience and a visual hierarchy.</p>

        <p>Visual hierarchy refers to the arranging of components in ascending or descending order of importance. This is accomplished using proportion, color, images, contrast, typography, whitespace, texture, and style.
        A critical purpose of visual hierarchy is to provide a focal point; this indicates to visitors where the most critical information is located.</p>

        <img

        />
        <p>White space (also called “negative space”) is the portion of a web page that remains “empty.” It’s the space between graphics, margins, gutters, space between columns, space between lines of type, or visuals.
        It’s not just “blank” space—it’s an important element of web design. It enables objects within it to exist. White space is all about the use of hierarchy for information, typography, color, or images.
        A page without white space, crammed full of text or graphics, risks appearing busy or cluttered. Typically, it’s difficult to read. (People won’t even bother.) This is why simple websites are scientifically better. </p></section>
