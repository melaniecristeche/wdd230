        <p>People say that opposites attract and this can be true for elements of design as well. 
            Imagine a composition without contrast –every color, font, shape, etc. would be the same size, and that design would be rather dull. Contrast is the tool that makes a design “pop,” making it memorable for viewers.
  
          Contrast also aids in the usability of a composition. A design’s organization is dependent upon how contrast is used to lead a viewer’s eye towards what is most important. For instance, if all the content within a design was the same size, how would your audience know what information is the most significant? 
          Through contrast designers are able to highlight certain elements they want to emphasize, creating a focal point for an audience and a visual hierarchy.</p>
